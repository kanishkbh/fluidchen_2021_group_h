Solution to exercise 7 : 

The below are values for U(25,43)

For mesh size (16,16)     0.183833
For mesh size (32,32)     nan
For mesh size (64,64)     -nan
For mesh size (128,128)     nan
For mesh size (256,256)     nan


We see that for finer meshes the method fails to be stable for a fixed time step 
In these cases an adaptive mesh refinement makes sense.
